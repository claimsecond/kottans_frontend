Just finished [How to use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775) and [try.github.io](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) 

Udacity course is good one. Very straightforward and gives a solid background in using github. After this course try.github.io is needed just to repeat basic concepts once again from different point of view. 
Highly recommend additional reading [Git на практике](https://sohabr.net/habr/post/342116/) which is describing how it looks like on practice.
